# Alberta Pathfinding Tool (Prototype)

Open-source Streamlit app for searching small business programs, funding and supports in Alberta.

## Repository notes
- The root-level `.gitignore` sits beside `app.py` and `requirements.txt`. In GitHub's file list it may be hidden by default; click the **Toggle hidden files** (eyeball) icon to reveal it and add new ignore rules there.

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
